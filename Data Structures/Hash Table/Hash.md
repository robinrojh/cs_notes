Name: Direct Addressing Table

Description: A data structure that makes use of hashing functions to match data

Space Complexity: O(n)

| Operations | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| insert     | O(1)            |                  |
| delete     | O(1)            |                  |
| search     | O(1)            |                  |

Remarks:
DONT FORGET ABOUT HASH FUNCTION COMPLEXITY!
