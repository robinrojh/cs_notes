Name: Binary Search Tree

Description: A special type of binary tree

O(N) Space Complexity

| Operations  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| insert      | O(n), O(h)      |                  |
| delete      | O(n), O(h)      |                  |
| search      | O(n), O(h)      |                  |
| traversal   | O(n), O(h)      |                  |
| rotate      | O(1)            |                  |
| predecessor | O(n), O(h)      |                  |
| successor   | O(n), O(h)      |                  |

Remarks: a linear tree will have a time complexity of O(n) for most operations
