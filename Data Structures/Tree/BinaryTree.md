Name: Binary Tree

Description: A tree that starts with a root node, and each node has at most two children.
Can be read using preorder + inorder, postorder + inorder 
O(n) space needed

| Operations | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| insert     | O(n)            |                  |
| remove     | O(n)            |                  |
| search     | O(n)                |                  |
| traversal  | O(n)            |                  |
