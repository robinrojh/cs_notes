Name: AVL Tree

Description: A binary search tree with an additional property that the left subtree node height and right subtree node height cannot differ by more than one

Space complexity: O(n)

| Operations  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| insert      | O(log n)        |                  |
| delete      | O(log n)        |                  |
| search      | O(log n)        |                  |
| traversal   | O(log n)        |                  |
| rotate      | O(log n)        |                  |
| predecessor | O(log n)        |                  |
| successor   | O(log n)        |                  |
