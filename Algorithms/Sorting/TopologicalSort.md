#### Description:
1. makes use of DFS/BFS
2. applied on a DAG
3. linear ordering of all vertices in DAG, such that each vertex comes before all other vertices that it has an outbound edge to
#### Time Complexity: 
- Worst: 
- Average: O(V + E)
- Best: 

#### Remarks
1. DFS toposort: use post-order traversal
2. BFS toposort: Khan's algorithm
